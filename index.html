  Prototyping is key to creating a functional system, but before we start our own prototype there are a couple of things that we had to take into consideration. First, we have to look at the feedback that we received on our project. The main criticism we received on our proposed idea was that our toy seemed annoying and not likely to help a person calm down. A suggestion we were given was to create something that would soothe an overwhelmed person through sounds. With that in my mind, instead of making something that would copy the user, we decided to make something that would take speech from the user and turn it into soothing music. Since we decided to use speech recognition, we decided to use Raspberry Pi for our project because we were recommended to use this single board computer if we wanted to work with speech. By this time, we have realized that our project has taken a different turn. Initially, we wanted to create a toy that would copy the user's sounds to encourage them to express themselves vocally, but have now changed it into a device that would turn a person's words into music to make them feel comfortable when speaking to themselves. This leads us to how we want to present our project. We dropped the idea of the toy and we thought of  two alternative options: a music box or a pillow. We like the idea of the pillow because it fits with the idea of creating a calm and soothing environment for the user, but, for the prototype, we decided to use a box since it would be easier to handle while presenting it.Overall, our initial project idea has definitely changed into something different but its intention to help people express themselves with the goal of helping them calm down is still there, just with a different approach.

  When building the prototype, there were a couple of things that we definitely needed such as a Raspberry pi computer, a microphone, a speaker and of course a breadboard and wires. We thought of also including an exelometer and LEDs to make the device more interesting by making it light up when picked up, but we decided to focus on the main function of our project, which is to turn speech into music. Since we will be using a Raspberry pi board, there is a SD card that will serve as the memory for the computer, so we had to make sure that it was empty for it to have enough for the project. Because we are using speech recognition, we connected a small microphone to one of the USB ports available this way the Raspberry pi can recognize speech. To then make the music play, we must connect a speaker to either the USB port or the audio-jack. In addition, we of course need power, which will come from the micro-USB available on the Raspberry pi. Furthermore, the box chosen had to be big enough to contain everything and we had to put in a hole that would allow the device to be plugged to a power outlet.
